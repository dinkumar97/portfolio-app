# Netlify redirects configuration for SPA routing
# This ensures all routes are handled by Angular's router
# and preserves hash fragments for Netlify Identity

## Don't rewrite internal Netlify API paths so Git Gateway can route correctly
/.netlify/*    /.netlify/:splat   200

## Serve admin panel files (Netlify CMS) for /admin/* routes
/admin/*    /admin/index.html   200

## SPA fallback - keep at the bottom
/*    /index.html   200
