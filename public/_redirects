# Netlify redirects configuration for SPA routing and Netlify CMS
# Order matters: put exact service routes (Netlify API /admin) before the SPA fallback

# Allow Netlify's internal API paths like /.netlify/git/* to be served and avoided by SPA rewrite
/.netlify/*    /.netlify/:splat   200

# Serve admin panel files (Netlify CMS) for /admin/* routes
/admin/*    /admin/index.html   200

# SPA fallback - keep at the bottom
/*    /index.html   200
